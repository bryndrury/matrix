# matrix
Familiarising myself with the computation taking place on the computer that correspond to matrix calculations that I use all the time.

As I study Physics I'm using matracies all the damn time, so I wanted to formalise my understanding of matrix computations and also have a useful bit of code for future projects.
It will eventually be in a single header file so it's easier to include in other projects.
